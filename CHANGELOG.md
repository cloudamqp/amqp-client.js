## Added

- Support for clients to negotiate channel-max ([#86](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqp-client.js/pull/86))

- Close sockets not supporting amqp protocol ([#78](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqp-client.js/pull/78))

## Changed

- Throws and rejects with `Error` as per best practice ([#81](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqp-client.js/pull/81))

### Added

- AMQPClient#onerror, will be called whenever ther connection is closed, override it to create reconnect logic.
- Export types for queue, exchange and consume parameters

### Fixed

- Use a pool of buffers so that multiple microtasks can publish simultaneously
- Don't set an IP as SNI hostname, only proper hostnames
- Decode username/password in URL properly

### Changed

- Allow publishing of `null` and let AMQPMessage#body be null when a body is missing

## [2.0.3] - 2022-03-07

### Fixed

- Heartbeat support

### Fixed

- Frame errors because frame buffer was reused

### Changed

### Changed

- No default exports, only named: `import { AMQPClient } from "@cloudamqp/amqp-client"`

## [1.3.2] - 2022-01-12

### Fixed

## [1.3.1] - 2022-01-03

### Changed

- Use Buffer for string encoding/decoding for >100% performance boost

- Rewrite in TypeScript

### Fixed

- Queue purged never resolved

### Added
